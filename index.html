      Sketchy workaround that is seemingly required to get z3-solver to
      actually work. Had to copy built files from /node_modules into /public.

      cp \
        node_modules/z3-solver/build/z3-built.js \
        node_modules/z3-solver/build/z3-built.wasm \
        node_modules/z3-solver/build/z3-built.worker.js \
        public
